QR Code Generator using Django
This is a simple Django web application that generates QR codes from user-provided URLs. Users can input a URL, and the application will generate a QR code for the given link.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python (3.x recommended)
Django
qrcode
Pillow (PIL, Python Imaging Library)
Any web server to serve your Django application (e.g., Gunicorn or Django's built-in development server)
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:



git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
cd qr-code-generator
Install the required Python packages using pip:



pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Django application:



python manage.py runserver
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000 or the appropriate address provided by Django's development server.

How to Use
Open the web application in your browser.

You will see a form with an input field where you can enter a URL.

Type a URL into the input field and click the "Generate QR Code" button.

The application will create a QR code image for the provided URL and display it on the web page.

You can download the QR code by right-clicking on the image and selecting "Save Image As."

Project Structure
qrview is the Django app responsible for generating QR codes.
The qrview/views.py file contains the logic for generating QR codes.
The QR code images are stored in the media folder.
Configuration
You can customize the QR code generation parameters, such as version, error correction, box size, and border size in the qrview/views.py file.

You can configure the media folder location in Django's settings (e.g., settings.py) using the MEDIA_ROOT variable.

Deployment
For deploying this application in a production environment, consider using a production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. Configure your web server to serve the Django application.
